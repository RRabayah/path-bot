# path-bot

path-bot is a small personal project I am working on to develop my skills in C++. The goal of path-bot is to create a grid of "blocks", defined in the gamelogic.cpp file, and to traverse through these blocks avoiding any walls using a trained deep learning neural network. Path-bot is made of two parts, one for creating the environment and agent, the other for creating the neural network which will control the agent.
